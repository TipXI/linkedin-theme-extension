# LinkedIn Theme Restorer Extension 🌗

> Automatically restores your preferred LinkedIn theme (dark/light/system) by recreating the `li_theme` cookie on startup.

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## 🧐 Why this exists
If you configure your browser to **delete cookies on exit** or use **Session-Only** browsing, LinkedIn forgets your Dark Mode preference every time you restart your browser. You are greeted with a blinding white screen until you manually change the setting.

This extension solves that by automatically injecting the specific `li_theme` cookie immediately upon browser startup.

## 🚀 Features
* **Privacy Focused:** Only touches the `li_theme` cookie. Does not read your session or password.
* **Lightweight:** Zero analytics, zero tracking code.
* **Cross-Browser:** Supports Chrome (MV3), Edge, and Firefox.
* **Configurable:** Choose between Dark, Light, or System Default in the extension settings.

## 🛠️ Development (Source Code)
* **Chrome:** Load the folder directly. The browser reads `manifest.json`.
* **Firefox:** You must temporarily rename `manifest-firefox.json` to `manifest.json` to test locally.
